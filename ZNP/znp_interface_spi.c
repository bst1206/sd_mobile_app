/**
* @file znp_interface_spi.c
*
* @brief Interface to the Zigbee Network Processor (e.g. CC2530ZNP) over the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) port.
*
* @note To output SPI transmit information, define ZNP_INTERFACE_SPI_VERBOSE.
* It is recommended to define this on a per-project basis. 
* In IAR, this can be done in Project Options : C/C++ compiler : Preprocessor
* In the defined symbols box, add:
* ZNP_INTERFACE_SPI_VERBOSE
*
* @see http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Tutorial_on_the_Examples and http://e2e.ti.com/support/low_power_rf/default.aspx
