/**
* @file af_zdo.c
*
* @brief Methods that implement the CC2530ZNP Application Framework / Zigbee Device Objects (AF/ZDO) interface.
* 
* The AF/ZDO interface is a more powerful version of the Simple API and allows you to configure, send, and receive Zigbee data.
* This file acts as an interface between the user's application and the ZNP physical interface.
* RFIC interface could be either SPI or UART.
* Refer to Interface Specification for more information.
*
* @note For more information, define AF_ZDO_VERBOSE. It is recommended to define this on a per-project basis. 
* In IAR, this can be done in Project Options : C/C++ compiler : Preprocessor
* In the defined symbols box, add:
* AF_ZDO_VERBOSE
*
* @see http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Tutorial_on_the_Examples and http://e2e.ti.com/support/low_power_rf/default.aspx

@param  clusterId which cluster this message is for. User definable. Zigbee supports up to 2^16 clusters. 
A cluster is typically a particular command, e.g. "turn on lights" or "get temperature". 
If using a predefined Zigbee Alliance Application Profile then this cluster will follow the Zigbee Cluster Library.
@param  data is the data to send.
@param  dataLength is how many bytes of data to send. Must be less than MAXIMUM_PAYLOAD_LENGTH.
@note On a coordinator in a trivial test setup, it takes approximately 10mSec from sending 
AF_DATA_REQUEST to when we receive AF_DATA_CONFIRM.
@note   <code>transactionSequenceNumber</code> is an optional user-definable reference number to match AF_DATA_REQUEST messages with AF_DATA_CONFIRM messages. 
@note   The ZNP will automatically require an ACK from the next device on the route when sending data. 
To require an ACK from the final destination, change MAC_ACK to APS_ACK at the expense of increased network traffic.
@note   The <code>radius</code> is the maximum number of hops that this packet can travel through before it will be dropped.
Should be set to the maximum number of hops expected in the network.
@note   adjust AF_DATA_CONFIRM_INTERVAL_MS and AF_DATA_CONFIRM_TIMEOUT_MS based on network size, number of hops, etc.
@pre    the application was started successfully
@pre    there is another device on the network with short address of <code>destinationShortAddress</code> 
and that device has successfully started its application.
@post   srsp will contain a AF_DATA_REQUEST_SRSP. We will receive a AF_DATA_REQUEST_SRSP regardless of whether the message was successfully sent or not.
@post   we will receive a AF_DATA_CONFIRM if the message was successfully sent.
